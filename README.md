# Debit-credit-card-check

This is a simple project that uses Luhn’s algorithm to validate a user's  Debit and credit card.
The program works for all popular cards like Visa, Rupay, MasterCard
Luhn’s algorithm checks for basic validations; for example, a Visa card should start with 4
and then moves on to complex digit-wise calculations. It is a good program to learn because
most e-commerce transactions require  debit and credit card validation.
